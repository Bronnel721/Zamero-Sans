# Zamero Sans
# Hey, what is this font about?
Zamero Sans is a versatile sans-serif with a basic but playful and modern feeling to it.
It's also a new version of Mmy first font, Mahone Sans, but with a few characters fully changed. While Mahone Sans had only one weight, I decided to add eight more styles to this font to make it an actual font family.

# How much characters and languages are in here?
The font has 806 characters in 298 languages (according to Hyperglot)

# And what's the license?
This font has an OFL license, so you can use if for both personal and commercial use. You can even modify it if you want!
