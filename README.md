# Hey, what is this font about?
Zamero Sans is a versatile sans-serif with a basic but playful and modern feeling to it.

It's also a new version of my first font made from scratch, Mahone Sans, but with a few characters fully changed. While Mahone Sans had only one weight, I decided to add eight more styles to this font to make it an actual font family. The weights go from Thin, ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold, and Black.

# How much characters and languages are in here?
The font has 806 characters in 298 languages (according to Hyperglot).

# And what's the license?
This font has an OFL license, so you can use if for both personal and commercial use. You can even modify it if you want!

# Can you add more styles?
That's actually one of my plans for this font! I don't know when, but I'll add more widths and probably an italic version later on.
